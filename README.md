I attempted multiple ways to get the view aspect to work in the week a8 assignment but none of the options worked. 
This caused me to no longer to be able to look in the site console to see if their where any problems.
Also when I hit Code and then use github desktop and then use Visual Studio Code to run the file it merges the rest of my files with it.
